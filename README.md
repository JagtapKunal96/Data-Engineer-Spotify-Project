# Data-Engineer-Spotify-Project

OBJECTIVE:

1.	Objective: Build a comprehensive data pipeline for extracting, transforming, and analyzing Spotify data using AWS services.

2.	Data Extraction: Integrate with the Spotify API to fetch relevant data and store it in an organized manner on AWS S3.

3.	Automation: Deploy code on AWS Lambda to automate the extraction process, running at scheduled intervals or triggering events.

4.	Data Transformation: Implement a function to clean and format the extracted data for further analysis, handling tasks like normalization, aggregation, and filtering.

5.	Efficiency and Reliability: Create an automated trigger to monitor changes or updates in the extracted data and execute the transformation function accordingly.

6.	Data Storage: Store the transformed data back in AWS S3, maintaining proper file organization and structure for easy access and retrieval.

7.	Analytics Setup: Utilize AWS Glue and Athena to create analytics tables, defining the data schema for efficient querying and analysis of the transformed data.

8.	Scalability and Reliability: Ensure the entire pipeline is scalable and reliable, capable of handling large volumes of data efficiently.

9.	Insights and Analytics: Enable various analytical purposes by unlocking valuable insights from the transformed data.
